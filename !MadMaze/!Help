It drove everyone mad at my school. Unfortunately, they stopped using 
Acorns (consarn it!) so my source of satisfaction was ended. So I've 
released it here.

MadMaze is, at first glance, a simple little game. You move a little # symbol 
around the screen (let's call him Mr.Hash). Occasionally, Mr Hash will get 
pulled into one of several sub-games. If he loses at this subgame, then it's 
game over, and Mr Hash will be back at the start again.

The Games
---------
Addled Addition -- solve the sum within ten seconds or you die.

The Star-Struck Lion -- How fast are you able to read? A name appears on 
screen for a fraction of a second. If you can't repeat it back, you'll be
killed.

Memory Jogger -- A combination to a safe appears on screen for a fraction 
of a second, which you must memorise. If you fail, then you die!

Searchlight -- You need to retrieve the key to a locked door. Unfortunately, 
the key is guarded by a searchlight. You can hide behind rocks, but if the 
searchlight spots you, you're captured. Which means you're dead. Again.

Hilo -- A 10-sided dice is rolled five times. Gamble successfully on the 
score being higher or lower each time and you'll escape. If not, your game is 
over.

Death Ride -- Navigate your little HaShipç through the Valley of Death 
(no, not the one in that Gangsta Rap song). If you crash, you die.

Fungus -- The screen is infested by Fungus. Can you escape to safety (AKA 
a little flashing blob in the top-left hand corner) within 30 seconds?

Bacteria -- The screen is infested by Bacteria. Can you escape to safety 
(AKA a little flashing blob in the top-left hand corner) within 30 seconds?

Yes, I know it sounds similar, but it's a different game. Honest guv.

Rockfall -- Rocks are falling. Avoid them or they'll squash you. And you'll 
be dead.

Pigeon Hole -- Ten numbers appear at random. Get them in ascending order 
in ten boxes, numbered from 0 to 9. Sounds easy? Well, it's not. If you get 
one number out of order, the merciless Percy Pigeon will peck you to death. 
You can discard three numbers by pressing D.

Remember That Tune? -- you'll hear a sequence of notes, which you must then
repeat back (by pressing keys 1 to 5). Get the sequence wrong and you die. You
must get it right 4 times (the sequence lengthens each time) to win.

Invisible Maze -- You're trapped in a maze with walls you can't see until you
bump into them. You have one minute to maneuvre through the maze (using the
cursor keys) and reach the exit.

ALSO: Watch out for vortexes which will transport you to another place on the
maze. This can be handy if they dump you near the exit, but, on the other
hand, are not handy if they plop you back at the start.



This game is, by my own admission, most unfair. Some of the games require 
huge amounts of skill, in others you'll be relying solely on luck. But it'll
keep you coming back for more...

If you want flashy graphics, you're looking in the wrong place, matey. Just 
imagine you're playing …lite or Iron Dignity. 

!BOOT

Note that from version 1.73 onwards MadMaze saves its high scores into the
user's Choices directory if it exists. If you are not using a standard !Boot
application (ie you are a RISC OS 3.1 user who has not installed the Universal
Boot) MadMaze will continue to save scores in its application directory as
previously.
